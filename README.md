#### The following changes are presently not working due to a hard-coded limitation of the game engine, however they have been left in place in case someone figures out a way around this. I have updated the item descriptions so they no longer reflect these changes:

-   ~~Mk.1 Pipeline: Changed flow rate from 300m³ to 600m³~~
-   Mk.2 Pipeline: Changed flow rate from 600m³ to 1200m³
